# This repository presents a computationally effective Attention Mechanism based Text-to_Speech (TTS) model
There are two proposed models: using (i) simple attention mechanism and (ii) multi-head attention mechanism.
# Dataset
Download and extract the LJSpeech dataset from https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/

# Requirements
TensorFlow: 2.19.0; NumPy: 1.26.4; Librosa: 0.11.0

# Usage
The models can be run in various ways, for an example, using 'python3 multihead_attention_proposed_model.py' from the terminal.
