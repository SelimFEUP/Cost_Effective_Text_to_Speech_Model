# This repository presents a computationally effective Attention Mechanism based Text-to-Speech (TTS) model
There are two proposed models: using (i) simple attention mechanism and (ii) multi-head attention mechanism.
# Dataset
Download and extract the LJSpeech dataset from https://keithito.com/LJ-Speech-Dataset/

# Usage
The models can be run in various ways, for an example, using 'python3 multihead_attention_proposed_model.py' from the terminal.
